/*18. Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Write program that allows two players to play a game or tic-tac-toe. Use a two-
dimensional char array with three rows and three columns as the game board. Each
element of the array should be initialized with an asterisk (*). The program should run a
loop that does the following:
Displays the contents of the board array.
Allows player 1 to select a location on the board for an X. The program should ask
the user to enter the row and column numbers.
Allows player 2 to select a location on the board for an O. The program should ask
the user to enter the row and column numbers,
â€¢
Determines whether a player has won, or a tie has occurred. If a player has won,
the program should declare that player the winner and end. If a tie has occurred, the
program should display an appropriate message and end.
Player 1 wins when there are three As in a row on the game board. The As can appear in a
rOW, in a column, or diagonally across the board. Player 2 wins when there are three Os in
a row on the game board. The Os can appear in a roW, in a column, or diagonally across
the board. A tie occurs when all of the locations on the board are full, but there is no winner.*/
